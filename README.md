# YouTube userscript: Remember current time stamp

This userscript puts the time stamp in the URL (e.g. `&t=3m14s`) every time the video is paused, except if the video is within its last 5 seconds.
If you keep the tabs in your browser open and want to safely keep the “state” of where you left off watching a video, [install this script on GreaseMonkey][install]!
